## Data Download and Pre-Processing for Running Pangu weather on singularity.
Downloading ECMWF Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) data via the Registry on Climet Data Store(https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets) and pre-processing it for training the Pangu weather model.
## Directory structure.
- data              for train, test data.
- dataset_download  for raw data from CDS.
- pangu             for pangu weather train script with physicsnemo.
- pangu-24          for pangu weather train script with modulus. 
- run               for run train.
